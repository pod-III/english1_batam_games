English 1 Batam - Teacher Activity Hub 🍎
Welcome to the English 1 Batam Activity Hub, a specialized suite of interactive web-based tools designed by Fahrul for ELT (English Language Teaching) in Batam, Indonesia. This platform is tailored for students aged 3–18, providing a seamless bridge between classroom management and gamified learning.

🌟 Overview
This hub is a desktop-optimized, high-performance web application designed for projector-based teaching. It consolidates over 29 interactive activities into a single interface, utilizing a "Chunky" design aesthetic that is both visually engaging for young learners and highly legible for those in the back of the classroom.

🎨 Design Philosophy & Theme
Built using the English 1 Signature Palette, the UI ensures brand consistency and a friendly atmosphere:

Pink (#FF6B95): Playful & Creative
Orange (#FF8C42): High Energy & Interaction
Green (#00E676): Success & Progression
Blue (#2979FF): Logic & Classroom Utility
Key UI Features:
Desktop-First Design: Optimized for mouse/keyboard navigation and large-screen projection.
Blackboard Mode: A one-click toggle to invert the UI for low-light environments (High Contrast).
Teacher Console: Many games feature a hidden or integrated console for manual word input, allowing real-time customization based on the day's lesson.
